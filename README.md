# Cellular Automata
---

What would the world be without cellular automation? I certainly don't know. This 
project is currently a first try at `SDL2 library` and Clion for a IDE. Up till now I've
used `VIM` and `Git` command line style. Maybe it might turn into something more at some point, 
who knows.
